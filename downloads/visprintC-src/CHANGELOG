Previous versions: 
	(this is the information about the visprint code version history
	 that I have been able to gather so far)
	
	27 Aug 2004 Soren Andersen's version
	- He added the png and transparency code. 
	  His version is still available at:
	  http://www.polettix.it/cgi-bin/wiki.pl/Programming/visprint_with_transparency

	August 1998 David Johnston's version (win95 console port)
	- He added the ability to specify background color, image resolution,
	  and color intensity on the command line. He also optimized the 
	  positioning and magnification of the fractal so that there isn't
	  any wasted space in the image.

	?? Ian Goldberg's original version
	- No info available on the net. (Or at least I was unable to find any).
	  Any help on this will be highly appreciated.
